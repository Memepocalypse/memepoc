## Why Memepocalypse?

In today’s fast-paced digital world, meme coins pop up and vanish at an unprecedented rate. Many of these meme coins are launched hastily, without genuine purpose, and are often driven by short-term gains. This phenomenon has led to a rising number of **rug pulls**—where creators quickly abandon projects after profiting, leaving supporters with nothing. The cycle erodes trust and diminishes the value of meme coins, ultimately threatening the very foundation of meme culture in the crypto space.

By joining Memepocalypse, you become part of a movement to preserve the cultural significance of memes while resisting the short-lived, exploitative trends that threaten to undermine the meme coin landscape.

## The Evolution of Memes and the 2024 Tsunami of Meme Coins

### Introduction to Memes
Memes have long served as symbols of cultural exchange, transcending mediums from ancient artifacts to the digital age. Modern meme culture has evolved from historical symbols, graffiti, and expressions to internet memes and, more recently, crypto-related memes.

- **Historical Memes**
  - **Kilroy Was Here (1940s, WWII):** A simple cartoon figure with "Kilroy Was Here" became a viral symbol during WWII.

- **Early Internet Memes (1990s-2000s)**
  - **Dancing Baby (1996):** One of the first viral digital memes, a 3D-rendered baby animation, became a pop culture sensation.

1. **PEPECOIN:** Inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme, this coin gained significant social media traction.
2. **DOGE V2:** An improved version of Dogecoin, launched on Solana.
3. **LOLToken:** Integrated social media features and meme-sharing rewards.
