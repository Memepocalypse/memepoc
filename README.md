## The Evolution of Memes and the 2024 Tsunami of Meme Coins

### Introduction to Memes
Memes have long served as symbols of cultural exchange, transcending mediums from ancient artifacts to the digital age. Modern meme culture has evolved from historical symbols, graffiti, and expressions to internet memes and, more recently, crypto-related memes.

### Timeline of Memes

  - **Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (c. 3200 BCE):** Hieroglyphs in Egypt depicted animals performing human tasks, reflecting an early form of humor.

- **Historical Memes**
  - **Kilroy Was Here (1940s, WWII):** A simple cartoon figure with "Kilroy Was Here" became a viral symbol during WWII.

- **Early Internet Memes (1990s-2000s)**
  - **Dancing Baby (1996):** One of the first viral digital memes, a 3D-rendered baby animation, became a pop culture sensation.
  - **All Your Base Are Belong to Us (2000):** This phrase from the video game *Zero Wing* became iconic in early internet meme culture.

- **Shiba Inu (SHIB) (2020):** Dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” Shiba Inu gained popularity following Dogecoin’s success.

### The 2024 Tsunami of Meme Coins on Solana
In 2024, Solana became the go-to platform for meme coins due to its low fees and high transaction speeds. Notable meme coins include:

1. **PEPECOIN:** Inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme, this coin gained significant social media traction.
2. **DOGE V2:** An improved version of Dogecoin, launched on Solana.
3. **LOLToken:** Integrated social media features and meme-sharing rewards.
